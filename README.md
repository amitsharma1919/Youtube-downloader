Youtube-Downloader
==================

Downloads Youtube Videos and Playlists

This is pretty straightforward downloader with a simple ui. Just copy the link of the youtube video/playlist URL and just run the script. The script will automatically start downloading the video with the URL you just copied. You'll have options to pick quality of the video.

Support for multi thread downloading and better ui experience to be added soon.
